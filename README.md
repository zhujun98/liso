LISO was created during my first period at DESY to facility accelerator beamline optimization.
Now, it aims to provide an high-level API to:

1. Run a large numbers of simulations asynchronously; 
2. Provide a unified format to store the simulation data and the measurable counterparts from 
experiments;
3. Provide a toolbox to process and visualize the data for deep learning and deep reinforcement 
learning studies.
