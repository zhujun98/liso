Reading Experimental Data
=========================

.. _Reading experimental data in HDF5 formats: notebooks/exp_reading_data_in_hdf5.ipynb

In this section, we will be reading and exploring data generated by
:ref:`parameter scan <parameter scan with doocs>` or
:ref:`data acquisition <data acquisition with doocs machine interface>`.
Check this tutorial about how to `Reading experimental data in HDF5 formats`_.

The experimental data reading API in LISO is very similar to the
`EXtra-data <https://extra-data.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ API, which is
extensively used by beamline scientists and users at European XFEL. Indeed,
the design of data reading API in LISO is inspired by `EXtra-data` and aims
to stay as close as possible to it. It is foreseen in the near future,
LISO will be able to read a virtual dataset (VDS) consisting of both data
from the accelerator and the user sides.

However, there are fundamental differences between `DOOCS` and `Karabo`.
Every signal (data) known to `DOOCS` is called a channel. A channel is
identified by its unique address consisting of 4 components of the form of
`Facility/Device/Location/Property`. While in `Karabo`, the data are
categorized into control data identified by `Device/Property` and instrument
data identified by `Device/OutputChannel`. The control data is also called
"slow data" due to historical reasons, while the instrument data is also known
as "fast data" or "pipeline data".

In Karabo, the bottleneck of the data pipeline is the data from bunch-resolved
(pulse-resolved) area detectors like AGIPD, LPD and DSSC, which can produce
up to thousands of megapixel images per second. To the best of my knowledge,
there is no such kind of detectors on the accelerator side.
