Reading Simulated Data
======================

Reading simulated raw data
--------------------------

Raw data refers to the data generated by the simulation code.


Reading simulated data in HDF5 format

In this section, we will be reading and exploring data generated by
:ref:`injector scan using astra`. Check this tutorial about how to
`Reading simulated data in HDF5 formats`_.

LISO tries to keep the API of reading simulated data akin to that of reading
experimental data as much as possible. In experiments, the *macropulse ID* is
the only identity that we can trust to align data from different channels.
However, we do not have the same issue in simulations. Nevertheless, we still
introduced the *simulation ID* which is the counter part of the *macropulse ID*
and starts from 1 by default.
